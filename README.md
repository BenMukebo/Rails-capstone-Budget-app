# Rails-capstone-Budget-app


## Description

> The Ruby on Rails capstone project ([remember what they are?](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-html-css/blob/main/articles/capstone_intro.md)) is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

- I created a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

  - register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
  - introduce new transactions associated with a category.
  - see the money spent on each category.

## Learning objectives

- Use ruby gems as software packages system.
- Install Ruby on Rails framework.
- Understand Rails RESTful design and router.
- Use controllers to handle requests and render empty views.
- Use params from browser request in a safe way.
- Use preprocessed html file with embedded Ruby code.
- Use layouts and templates for shared content.
- Use database migration files to maintain database schema.
- Use validations for models.
- Secure app from n+1 problems.
- Understand what ORM is.
- Write SQL queries with ActiveRecord.
- Set up associations between models.
- uild a webapp that requires the user to log in.
- Use devise gem for authentication.
- Limit access to webapp resources based on authorization rules.
- Analyze in writing why you have made a coding choice using one structure over another.


## Getting Started

To get a local copy for this project and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- You need to have git installed in your machine.
- Install a recent version of Postgres.
- Already install Rails


## Setup

## Setting Up PostgreSQL

- The postgres installation doesn't setup a user for you, so you'll need to follow these steps to create a user with permission to create databases

```bash
$  sudo -u postgres createuser blog-app -s
```

### Creating the Rails-capstone-Budget-app

- use PostgreSQL database 

```bash
$   rails new Rails-capstone-Budget-app --database=postgresql  #or
$   rails new Rails-capstone-Budget-app -d postgresql

$   cd Rails-capstone-Budget-app # Move into the application directory
```


### Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BenMukebo/Blog-app.git
$ cd Blog-app
```

### Create the database

```bash
$   rails db:create   # or
$   rake db:create
```

### Creating the hello-rails Application

- use PostgreSQL database 

```bash
$   rails new blog-app --database=postgresql  #or
$   rails new blog-app -d postgresql

$   cd hello-rails # Move into the application directory
```

### Install linter and 

- Rubocop gem

```bash
$  bundle init
$  bundle install
```
- Stylelint package

```bash
$  npm init -y
$  npm install
$  npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x

```

- Run linter

```bash
$  rubocop .
$  npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" 
```

- In auto-correct mode, RuboCop will try to automatically fix offenses:

```bash
$  rubocop -A # or
$  rubocop --auto-correct-all
$  npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" --fix 
```


### Starting up the Web Server

```bash
$   rails s # or
$   rails server # or
$   rails server -p3001
```


#### Listing Existing Routes

- You can now visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your new website!

 You can also execute the `rails routes` command in your terminal to produce the same output.



#### Generate rspec

- At the first you need to include those lines in your Gemfile

```bash
  gem 'rails-controller-testing'
  gem 'rspec-rails'
```

#### Install RSpec

```bash
$  rails generate rspec:install
```
- This should generate some files that you will need to run your tests and should give us a Controller and a View

- Then run:

```bash
$  rspec spec     # to test if your tests are passed
```
#### Generate controllers

```bash
  $  rails generate controller users index show
  $  rails generate controller posts index show
```

#### Generate migration files

```bash
  $  rails generate migration CreateUsers
  $  rails generate migration CreatePosts
  $  rails generate migration CreateLikes
  $  rails generate migration CreateComments
  $  rails generate migration AddUserRefToComments
  $  rails generate migration AddPostRefToComments
  $  rails generate migration AddUserRefToLikes
  $  rails generate migration AddPostRefToLikes
  $  rails generate migration AddUserRefToPosts
```

#### Generate model

```bash
  $  rails generate model User name  photo bio:text posts_counter:integer  
  $  rails generate model Post  title  text:text comments_counter:integer likes_counter:integer author:references
  $  rails generate model Like author:references post:references 
  $  rails generate model Comments text:text author:references post:references
```

#### Generate Schema

- To push the Migration into the database

```bash
  $   rails db:migrate
```
- We use the seeds.rb file to records in the database
- To drop, create a table and to migrate and send the seed into the database:

```bash
  $   rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed  
```

- To check available routes

```bash
  $   rails routes  
```

#### Run Capybara

```bash
$  bundle exec rspec ./spec/features/user_show_spec.rb
$  bundle exec rspec ./spec/features/post_show_spec.rb
$  bundle exec rspec ./spec/features/user_post_index_spec.rb  
```
